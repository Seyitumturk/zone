high-risk of rabies, CES' will need to ask the customer if their dog meets
the definition of a commercial dog (see definition above) and advise them
that they will need to provide documentation upon entry that clearly
demonstrate they own and obtained ownership prior to entering Canada.
these documents, but we must inform the customer that if their dog is
not deemed admissible, it will be ordered removed from Canada at the
customer's expense.
If a customer informs you that they might not have sufficient proof of
ownership but still wish to travel, please add an SK NOTE to their CPR
confirming that they have been advised of the risk.

Backpack Kennel
The backpack kennel can only be placed on the ground under the seat in one of 2
ways:
Laying down with the straps on the floor
Given the space under seats, the logical placement would be in a laying position
with the straps (the part where the backpack lays against a person's back) on the
floor.
Having it upright or on any of its sides would not make it possible to fit under the
seat in front.

Pet Restraint Devices - Strollers and Car Seats

Carry-on Baggage
If customer is travelling with the pet in cabin (PETC):

OAL tickets and AE/OAL redemption tickets.

dimensions for the PETC kennel and enter them accurately in ARD WEB; this
will ensure the carrier will fit under the seat and will avoid refusal of carrier at
the airport.

quota reached, itinerary not eligible, etc.), any changes to their booking are as per fare

rules. The ticket can only be refunded if the purchase is within 24 hours (/sites/acpedia/en-
ca/Pages/Universal%20-%20PSS/24-Hour-Rule.aspx).

Exception: If the customer accepts to be downgraded to a lower cabin, the change fee and
any ADCL can be waived. Make sure to remark the PNR accordingly.

appropriate ownership of the dog, refer to the section “Dogs Originating from Countries With
a High Risk of Rabies into Canada.” (/sites/acpedia/en-ca/Pages/Universal%20-

Gates
If controlling a flight operating a B777 or B788/B789, keep in mind that only specific
seats can be used for PETC due to limited space under the seat. Inflight Service
refers the customer back to the gate for reseating if they are not seated in the
proper seats and all efforts must be made to reseat the customer in the appropriate
seats. Refer to the section on Seating (/sites/acpedia/en-ca/Pages/Universal%20-
%20PSS/Pet-in-Cabin-%28PETC%29.aspx#Seating).
Ensure a final check is done to ensure maximum numbers of PETC per aircraft type
is not exceeded. Display the commented passenger list in CM.
International Arrival Stations (Barbados)
All Stations: Ensuring PETC is commented on customers' CPR is important as the leads on
duty in Barbados follow the process below during their pre-flight checks.
If information is missing, check the PNR as there may be more details available.
Follow local SOP for communicating AVIH/PETC arrival to the appropriate parties
(Customs and Immigration, security companies, etc.).
For failures send an e-mail to airports.help.desk@aircanada.ca
(mailto:airports.help.desk@aircanada.ca) advising the flight number, date,
customer's name and failure type (for example, no AVIH or PETC comment on CPT
or CPR).
Maple Leaf Lounge Access
Customers entitled to use the Maple Leaf Lounge travelling with PETC are allowed full usage
of the Lounge provided that the pet remains in a petcarrier at all times and with the
owner as per the general policy.

Customers with Allergies
Severe Allergies

Refer to (/sites/acpedia/en-ca/Pages/Universal%20-%20PSS/Customers-with-a-

to a Severe Allergy to Cats/Dogs (/sites/acpedia/en-ca/Pages/Universal%20-
%20PSS/Customers-with-a-Disability-due-to-a-Severe-Allergy-to-Cats-Dogs.aspx).
Mild or Moderate Allergies
Customers with mild or moderate allergies may not wish to be seated too closely to a
cat or dog during their flight. Allergy sufferers should be advised to inform the
acceptance specialist or gate specialist prior to their flight departure to ensure they are
notseated next to a customer travelling with a pet. Every reasonable effort should be
made to move the customer or the pet and pet owner. Applicable seat fees are not
waived.
Airport Specialists Procedures
Enter a comment on customer's CPR record (and any subsequent downline
connections). Comment should be entered in an SSR format to facilitate handling at
the gate. The SSR format is also printed on the Passenger Information List (PIL) to
alert inflight.
Comments should be added as follows:
Allergic to dogs
For Air Georgian and Exploits Mountain Air flights:
There are no flight attendants on Air Georgian and Exploits Mountain Air BEH
aircraft, therefore, the control specialist at the gate must move either the
customer with the allergy or the PETC owner.
Should the issue arise onboard, the First Officer is responsible to reseat either
the pet owner or the allergy sufferer.

Prepare the Pet for Travel
Purchase pet carrier or kennel well in advance so the animal has time to become familiar
with its kennel.
Prior to arrival at airport, give pet adequate exercise.
Advise customer to take along a leash so that the pet can be taken for a walk prior to
departure and upon arrival.
Advise the customer to ensure the leash is removed prior to placing the pet in the kennel.
Provide water right up until acceptance.
Arrive at the airport early (at least 30 minutes prior to suggested acceptance times).
Identification tags with customer's home address, phone number as well as address and
phone number at destination, should be attached to pet carrier or kennel. It is a good
idea to include pet's name as well.
Include a favorite toy or item for your pet.
Do not padlock the kennel in case Air Canada staff needs to access the pet in the event of
an emergency.
In most cases, cats and dogs should not be given any tranquillizers or sedatives prior to
travel. Sedatives affect the animal's natural ability to maintain balance and equilibrium
which can be dangerous when the kennel is moved.

For internal use only.
